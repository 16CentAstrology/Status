## Contributing
Want to contribute to this project? We'd love to have your help!  Take a look at the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Status/blob/production/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you dive in. For many features, support data for browsers other than IE and Microsoft Edge comes from the [Chromium Dashboard](https://www.chromestatus.com) and bugs against that data can be filed [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard/issues).

Note that this GitHub project is *not* for making feature requests for or reporting bugs in Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge. Browser feedback can be provided through the [issue tracker](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/) and on [UserVoice](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer).
